challenge: MPESA was a blessing to kenyans and kenyan businesses. Soon enough it became an alternative defacto currency that had out grown its initial peer to peer vision. Equity bank required automation of MPESA functionalities in the absence of an MPESA API. 
goals:
- Automate the disbursements and deposits of MPESA in the absence API integration
- Integrate payment transaction to the core banking system
- Deploy loan and savings services via a SIM toolkit application with Safaricom
solution: Project "Ambata" (translated to "connect") was born with the need to innovate and do the impossible. Connect to safaricom and automate trasncation swithout an API. Because MPESA APIs were non existant at the time, we used existing MPESA portal. Using web robots or web drivers, we accurately and securly replicaed the web process to automate and integrate disbursements to and from the core banking system
results: We were able for the first time ever to handle over 2000 MPESA disbursements transactions per minute, from approximately 1000 every hour at best. MKESHO was ground breaking in ushering in numerous bank/mobile products and opeing up MPESA to teh business community in kenya. It opened up the peer to business industry for MPESA 
testimonial: Having tried a number of major software companies in the region, to our surprise, it was a member of the zegetech team that cracked this enormous challenge that put Equity bank on the map as a mobile focused and innovative brand. We were first to market and we loved it.
