challenge: Across the continent, Africans are saving and investing more of their own money. Currently, local investment clubs (Chamas) hold over Ksh35B (US$469Million) and one in every three adult Kenyans is a member of one, as reported by the chairman of the Kenya Association of Investment Groups (KAIG). Chamas however lack transparency, accountability, security and convenience, which affect their growth and effectiveness leading to stagnation and eventual disintegration.
goals:
- Build a mobile based solution for conveniently managing the informal savings groups operations
- Provide transparency and accountability to groups
- Use mobile money for savings and withdrawals
- Connect groups with each other for sharing information, knowledge and co-investments
solution: With pay4us, Chamas run their table banking activities to enable growth and sustainability. The use of mobile money unlocks the much needed convenience that groups needs to last. Pay4Us also aims to empower the members with financial literacy. By enabling sustainability of micro-finance we unlock the doors to sustainable development and empowerment of the Africa people.
results: Through the Pay4Us android application, over 40 savings groups were managed with a total membership of 724. The Android application was built for offline an online use and payments were processed on MPESA.
testimonial: I thoroughly enjoyed my time working on Pay4Us. My days spent in Kibera and Korogosho brought meaning to my work and determination to see these groups acheive things greater that either of the members would alone. I truly saw the power of many. For this I love zegetech, because we not only took up projects that paid then bills, but most importantly those that made a difference, truely living up to our motto, innovate 4 life
