challenge: For the modern business, technology is neccesary to grow a steady customer base. Businesses with more that 100 repeat customers especially need systems to track, keep and grow their customers. Receiving mobile payments that automatically fit into the busienss process is extreemly critical to ensure on overheads in additional reconciliation tasks
goals:
- Integrate multiple mobile money operators and SMS gateways
- Provide businesses with an easy to use portal for managing their payments, products or services, customers and engagement

Built on Ruby on Rails, it is a highly performant system with initial benchmarks at over 2000 transactions per second per process. 
testimonial: As a developer having tried out many other payment solution in the market, I can confirm that MPAYER is a very unique and brilliant system. It's APIs are rich and easy to use with simple out of the box workflows. Unlike the rest, it not only processes payments, but it also provides customer insights  and i can extend its functionality... all at a very reasonable cost. That's a definite win.
